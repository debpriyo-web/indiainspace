<p style="font-family:'Courier New'color:black;font-size:13px;">The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), (Hindi: Bharatiya Antriksa Anusandhan Sangathan) is the space agency of 
the Government of India and has its headquarters in the city of Bengaluru. Its vision is to "harness space technology 
for national development while pursuing space science research & planetary exploration". The Indian National Committee 
for Space Research (INCOSPAR) was established by Jawaharlal Nehru under the Department of Atomic Energy 
(DAE) in 1962, with the urging of scientist Vikram Sarabhai recognising the need in space research. INCOSPAR grew and became 
ISRO in 1969,also under the DAE. In 1972, the Government of India had set up a Space Commission and the 
Department of Space (DOS), bringing ISRO under the DOS. The establishment of ISRO thus institutionalised space research
activities in India. It is managed by the DOS, which reports to the Prime Minister of India.

ISRO built India's first satellite, Aryabhata, which was launched by the Soviet Union on 19 April 1975. It was named 
after the mathematician Aryabhata. In 1980, Rohini became the first satellite to be placed in orbit by an Indian-made 
launch vehicle, SLV-3. ISRO subsequently developed two other rockets: the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) for 
launching satellites into polar orbits and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) for placing satellites 
into geostationary orbits. These rockets have launched numerous communications satellites and Earth observation satellites. 
Satellite navigation systems like GAGAN and IRNSS have been deployed. In January 2014, ISRO used an indigenous cryogenic 
engine CE-7.5 in a GSLV-D5 launch of the GSAT-14.

ISRO sent a lunar orbiter, Chandrayaan-1, on 22 October 2008, which discovered lunar water in the form of ice, and 
the Mars Orbiter Mission, on 5 November 2013, which entered Mars orbit on 24 September 2014, making India the first 
nation to succeed on its maiden attempt to Mars, as well as the first space agency in Asia to reach Mars orbit. 
On 18 June 2016, ISRO launched twenty satellites in a single vehicle, and on 15 February 2017, ISRO launched 
one hundred and four satellites in a single rocket (PSLV-C37), a world record. ISRO launched its heaviest 
rocket, Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle-Mark III (GSLV-Mk III), on 5 June 2017 and placed a communications 
satellite GSAT-19 in orbit. With this launch, ISRO became capable of launching 4-tonne heavy satellites into GTO. 
On 22 July 2019, ISRO launched its second lunar mission Chandrayaan-2 to study the lunar geology and the distribution 
of lunar water.

Future plans include development of the Unified Launch Vehicle, Small Satellite Launch Vehicle, development of a 
reusable launch vehicle, human spaceflight, a space station, interplanetary probes, and a solar spacecraft mission.</p>
